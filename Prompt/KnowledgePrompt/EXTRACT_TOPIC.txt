Given the input `[INPUT]` [PREVIOUS_CONTEXT]
analyze the semantic meaning of the subject and break it down into key sub-topics directly related to the subject. Provide the output in a JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    // list of sub-topics directly related to the semantic meaning of the input
  ]
}
```

The value of the `topics` key should be a list of sub-topics that are semantically relevant to the input, focusing on what the user intends to explore. Avoid including related or broader topics.
